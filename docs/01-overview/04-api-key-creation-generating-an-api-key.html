<h3 id="overview-api-key-creation-generating-an-api-key">Generating an API key</h3>
<p>Create an API key on the website before signing any requests. After creating an API key, keep the following information safe:</p>
<ul>
<li>API key</li>
<li>Secret key</li>
<li>Passphrase</li>
</ul>
<p>The system returns randomly-generated API keys and SecretKeys. You will need to provide the Passphrase to access the API. We store the salted hash of your Passphrase for authentication. We cannot recover the Passphrase if you have lost it. You will need to create a new set of API key.<br/><br/></p>
