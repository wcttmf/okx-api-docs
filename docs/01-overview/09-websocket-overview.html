<h3 id="overview-websocket-overview">Overview</h3>
<p>WebSocket is a new HTML5 protocol that achieves full-duplex data transmission between the client and server, allowing data to be transferred effectively in both directions. A connection between the client and server can be established with just one handshake. The server will then be able to push data to the client according to preset rules. Its advantages include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The WebSocket request header size for data transmission between client and server is only 2 bytes.</li>
<li>Either the client or server can initiate data transmission.</li>
<li>There's no need to repeatedly create and delete TCP connections, saving resources on bandwidth and server.</li>
</ul>
