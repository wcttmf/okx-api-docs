<aside class="warning">
To improve security, we strongly recommend clients linked the API key to IP addresses<br/>
</aside>
<ul>
<li>Each API key can bind up to 20 IP addresses, which support IPv4/IPv6 and network segment formats.
<br/></li>
</ul>
<aside class="notice">
API keys that are not linked to an IP address and have `trade` or `withdraw` permissions will expire after 14 days of inactivity. (The API key of demo trading will not expire) <br/>
</aside>
<ul>
<li>Only when the user calls an API that requires API key authentication will it be considered as the API key is used.</li>
<li>Calling an API that does not require API key authentication will not be considered used even if API key information is passed in.</li>
<li>For websocket, only operation of logging in will be considered to have used the API key. Any operation though the connection after logging in (such as subscribing/placing an order) will not be considered to have used the API key. Please pay attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>Users can get the usage records of the API key with <code>trade</code> or <code>withdraw</code> permissions but unlinked to any IP address though <a href="/account/security">Security Center</a>.</p>
