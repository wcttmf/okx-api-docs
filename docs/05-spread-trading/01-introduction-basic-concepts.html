<li><strong>Spread -</strong> Entering a trade where the trader is long one instrument and short an offsetting quantity of a related instrument, forming a trade with two risk offsetting legs.</li>
<li><strong>Order-book -</strong> A collection of offers to trade an instrument or basket. Each offer contains a defined instrument or group of instruments, relevant quantity, and the price at which the offerer is willing to transact. Takers can then immediately consume these offers up to the full amount of quantity listed at the offered price. The pending order limit of spread trading is 500 across all spreads.</li>
