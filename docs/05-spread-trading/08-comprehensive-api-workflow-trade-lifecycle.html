<p>In order for a trade to take place, two orders must be crossed within a Spread's Order Book.</p>
<p>Obtain information about the state of an Order and determine if it has reached its final state by monitoring the <code>sprd-orders</code>WebSocket channel. The <code>state</code> key in the channel indicates the current state of the Order. If the state is <code>live</code> or <code>partially_filled</code>, it means that the Order still has available size (<code>sz</code>) that the creator or another user can take action on. On the other hand, if the state is <code>canceled</code> or <code>filled</code>, the Order no longer has any available actions that the creator or any other user can take action on.</p>
<p>It is important to closely track the values of the following attributes: <code>sz</code>(size),<code>pendingFillSz</code> (pending fill size), <code>canceledSz</code> (canceled size), and <code>accFillSz</code>(accumulated fill size). These attributes provide crucial information regarding the status and progression of the Order.</p>
